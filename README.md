Fine-Tuning GEMMA-2B for Doctor-Patient Interaction: Efficient Model Adaptation Using LoRA and 4-bit Quantization


## Model Details

### Model Description

Developed by: Shailesh Kumar Khanchandani
Shared by: Shailesh Kumar Khanchandani
Model type: Causal Language Model
Language(s) (NLP): English
License: Apache-2.0
Finetuned from model: google/gemma-2b

### Model Sources [optional]

Repository: Fine-Tuned GEMMA-2B
Paper: [More Information Needed]
Demo: [More Information Needed]


### Direct Use

The model is intended for direct use in generating contextually appropriate responses for doctor-patient interactions. It can be used in virtual assistants, chatbots, and other medical consultation platforms to assist healthcare providers in communicating with patients.


### Downstream Use [optional]

The model can be further fine-tuned for specific medical specialties or customized to fit the unique requirements of different healthcare systems.


### Out-of-Scope Use

The model is not intended for use in generating medical advice or diagnoses without human oversight. It should not be used in any scenario where critical health decisions are made solely based on its outputs.


## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model inherits biases present in the training data. Users should be cautious of potential biases and inaccuracies, particularly in sensitive medical contexts.


### Recommendations

Users should ensure that outputs are reviewed by qualified healthcare professionals before being utilized in a clinical setting. Continuous monitoring and updating of the model with diverse and representative data can help mitigate biases.
